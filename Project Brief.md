# _PROJECT BRIEF
- SOLIHIYA
- The browser-based configurator is based from the Filipino traditional weaving pattern called solihiya. 
The configurator defines a pavilion with varying openings that responds to light and solar angles
Solar Directions can be controlled by simple parameter sliders and serves as an attractor for pattern opening variations.
A color gradient is applied to mesh edges corresponding to the variety of attractor distances.
There are also parameter sliders that control height, and size of the smallest and largest openings
It is also possible to download the geometry as a mesh geometry in .obj format

# _PLUGINS
- Kangaroo2 for physics simulation
- A single pufferfish node Mesh Flip (flip)
